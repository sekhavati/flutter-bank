# flutter-bank

I recently began learning Flutter/Dart and built this application to put what I had learnt into practice. 

Overall I was impressed by the technology and found it straightforward to get going with. At first I didn't like the look of code you wrote when constructing widgets, I felt like the heavy indentation wasn't particularly readbable but over time I became acustom to it. The amount of stuff the Flutter library offers is superb - having said that though there is a lot to get familiar with (it reminds me of the JDK in someways) and this is where I feel I'd have to invest time if I was going to get serious about Flutter.

I hope to come back to this little app and improve it over time but I have many other things I'm planning to learn about. The code quality leaves something to be desired but was just a noddy app to kick start something.
