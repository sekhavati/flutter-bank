This is a small application I wrote after recently learning Flutter and Dart to put what I had learnt into practice. 

Overall I was impressed by the technology and found it straightforward to get going with. The amount of stuff Flutter offers out of the box is superb - having said that though there is a lot to get familiar with (it reminds me of the JDK in someways) and this is where I feel I'd have to invest time if I was going to get serious about it.

I hope to come back and improve this app over time but I have many other things I'm planning to learn about. The code quality leaves something to be desired as it was just a noddy app to kick start something :running:
